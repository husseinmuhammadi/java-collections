In Java, the `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` collections are used to keep data sorted. Both of these collections are part of the Java Collections Framework and are implemented using Red-Black Trees.

1. **TreeSet**: This is an implementation of the `Set` interface that uses a red-black tree to maintain the elements in a sorted order. It does not allow duplicate elements. When you insert elements into a `TreeSet`, they are automatically sorted according to their natural ordering (or based on a custom comparator if provided).

2. **TreeMap**: This is an implementation of the `Map` interface that also uses a red-black tree to store the keys in a sorted order. Each key in the map is associated with a value. Similar to `TreeSet`, elements are sorted according to their natural ordering or a custom comparator.

Both `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` provide logarithmic time complexity for basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search. However, keep in mind that maintaining the sorted order might introduce some performance overhead compared to unordered collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`.

Here's a simple example of how to use `TreeSet` to keep a sorted collection of integers:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<Integer> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();
        sortedSet.add(5);
        sortedSet.add(2);
        sortedSet.add(8);
        sortedSet.add(1);

        System.out.println("Sorted Set: " + sortedSet); // Output: Sorted Set: [1, 2, 5, 8]
    }
}
```

Remember to use `TreeSet` or `TreeMap` when you specifically need to maintain a sorted order. If sorting is not a requirement, other collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap` might be more efficient in terms of performance.
